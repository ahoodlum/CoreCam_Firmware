GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'timing_controllerrst_i_i_1' of the design has been
        inferred as Global Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR
        control is 'timing_controllerrst_i_i_1'.

GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.

Run Time and Memory Usage
-------------------------

   Total CPU Time: 0 secs
   Total REAL Time: 0 secs
   Peak Memory Usage: 63 MB
